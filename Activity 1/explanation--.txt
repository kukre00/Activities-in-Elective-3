This is my simple navigation bar

My approach in this code is so simple, it is just straight to the point. In this activity I use HTML, CSS, JavaScript only. 

HTML
I use the attribute of "<nav>" for the navigation bar to show 
the container of the home, about, services and contact. 
I also use some "href" so i can attach link in the item list

CSS
In styling my responsive navigation bar, I use the black and red color combination
with a touch of white to look simple but elegant in eyes. I use a hover in the navigation bar list
to see the item. I also add clicking effect to know that the item is already clicked.

JavaScript
I just add a "eventlistener" so when you hover in the service item it automatic shows the dropdown menu.
