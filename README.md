This is my simple navigation bar

My approach in this code is so simple, it is just straight to the point. In this activity, I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only. 

HTML
I use the attribute of "nav" for the navigation bar to show 
the container of the home, about, services, and contact. 
I also use some "href" so I can attach links in the item list

CSS
In styling my responsive navigation bar, I use the black and red color combination
with a touch of white to look simple but elegant in the eyes. I use the hover effect over the navigation bar list
to see the item. I also added a clicking effect to know the item is already clicked.

JavaScript
I just added an " event listener " so that when you hover over the service item, the dropdown menu automatically appears.
